# Smooth Izhikevich Model (SIZ)

The Izhikevich model is widely recognized for its ability to replicate the spiking behavior of biological neurons with computational efficiency. However, this new model introduces a smoothed approach to improve certain aspects of the original formulation, offering enhanced flexibility and applicability in specific scenarios.

To ensure reproducibility and provide a reference this repository includes two Colab notebooks:

1.  **IZ_Model**: A Python implementation of the Izhikevich model, based on the original  [MATLAB code](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/figure1.m).
    
2.  **SIZ_Model**: An implementation of the proposed "smooth Izhikevich" model.
    
Both notebooks are organized into three main sections:

1.  **Definitions**:  This section includes all necessary functions, parameters, and initial values required for the simulations.
    
2.  **Run**: Here, the models are solved, and the results are plotted for each neuron type using default parameter values.
    
3.  **Sheet**:  This section provides a comprehensive graphical summary (sheet) of all neuron types simulated in the model.
    
For consistency and comparability, the integration step size (`tau`) is set to  **0.1**  in both models. However, itâ€™s worth noting that in the original Izhikevich MATLAB code, the step size varies depending on the neuron type being simulated.

If you wish to experiment with custom parameters in the  **SIZ_Model**, you can modify and rerun the pipeline functions to explore different configurations.
